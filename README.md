# BeerHacking 

This repository will hold all the recipes, ideas, wiring schematics, source code and everything else related to the project.

## Project History

During You Sh0t The Sheriff conference 2010 some friends started to discuss how hard would be to brew enough beer to attend the event demmand, not that there wasn't enough booze there, there was a lot, but we wanted something different.
As usual, we started to think about names and logos, not the strategy, and, as expected, the only name we could think of was Beer Hacking.
After some weeks only Fio continued think about this idea and started to research about how to brew and started beerhacking.com as a journal of his findings on beer tasting and brewing.
During the years effffn joined in, along with Gaspar, Regis and Carlos Cabral, writing a little bit a bout beer, bars and related subjects.
Fio continued learning the art of homebrewing, teaching others on how to brew, spending a lot of money on books and equipment...
Today Beer Hacking's blog is on a hiatus. Too much stuff happening on everyone's personal and professional life, no time to write for fun only. But we continued to drink, brew and study.

Fio's homebrew equipment is always being upgraded, this time he wants to automate the process so he can increase the chances of replicability of he same recipe (the best beers he brew were never brewed the same). So he chose this place to share his findigns, his code and to be open for suggestions.

### Prerequisites

This project is based on a simple HERMS setup with:

* 1 Hot Liquor Tank 
* 1 Mash/Lauter tun
* 1 Boiler 
* 1 Pump to recirculate mash
* 1 Pump to recirculate hot water
* 3 DS18b20 sensors
* 2 Water flow sensors
* 1 Raspberry Pi 3B

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
